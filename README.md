# ImageManipulator

INTRODUCTION

Using AI and Computer Vision, a lot of data can be extracted from Images.
The most tideous and time-consuming task is the Pre-Processing of Images. One has to find the right filters and binarization and apply them in a sequence in the preprocessing stage to achieve the desired results in final. There is a lot of trial and error work needed to find the right preprocessing model.
The aim is to make a GUI based application which helps in Pre-Processing, so that the user does not have to edit code again and again. Instead the user can view the instantaneous changes after each step and proceed further and in the end get the desired code.


AIM OF THE PROJECT

The project is to create a GUI based application using Python-Tkinter module.This application is used to make the preprocessing part of Computer Vision easy and understandable.
The app is called ‘Image Preprocessing Manipulator’. The user has to select an image from the local computer. The user can the apply various filters from OpenCV library. The user can view the change made to the image after each filter is applied. The selected sequence of the filters is then converted to python code.
