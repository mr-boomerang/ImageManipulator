# ImageManipulator
Using AI and Computer Vision, a lot of data can be extracted from Images.
The most tideous and time-consuming task is the Pre-Processing of Images. One has to find the right filters and binarization and apply them in a sequence in the preprocessing stage to achieve the desired results in final. There is a lot of trial and error work needed to find the right preprocessing model.
The aim is to make a GUI based application which helps in Pre-Processing, so that the user does not have to edit code again and again. Instead the user can view the instantaneous changes after each step and proceed further and in the end get the desired code.
